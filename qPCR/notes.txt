These scripts were used to generate the figures for the paper:
* HiFit_pd.py: generation of the results for each published method
* dnn.py: generation of the results for the Deep Learning approach
* methods_comparison.py: generation of the figures to compare the methods

The figures to display curves and the figures adjustments were made with custom Jupyter notebooks.
